# Python-Work
My Journey Towards Learning Python for Engineering. Feel free to Check and Give me Feedback. Thank you... 

If you're interested, I've uploaded the following to my repository. I'll keep updating as I post more ✌🏻.

1. chessboard_check.py: A program that checks the validity of a given chessboard.

2. rockPaperScissors.py: A program for the classic Rock Paper Scissors game.

3. coin_flip_streaks.py: A program that evaluates the probability that 6 consecutive heads or tails will occur in a series of 100 coin flips. Intuitively, the probability might seems very small, but as this program shows, it is highly probable to occur. 
Try it out! You'll be surprised (or maybe not if you're good at statistics).
